Werkzeug Examples
=================

This directory contains various example applications and example code of
Werkzeug powered applications.  Nearly all of them are written for Python 2.4
and higher so don't expect them to work on Python 2.3.

Beside the proof of concept applications and code snippets in the partial
folder they all have external depencencies for template engines or database
adapters (SQLAlchemy only so far).


Full Example Applications
=========================

The following example applications are application types you would actually
find in real life :-)


`simplewiki`
    A simple Wiki implementation.

    Requirements:
    -   SQLAlchemy
    -   creoleparser
    -   genshi

    You can obtain all packages in the Cheeseshop via easy_install.

    Usage::

        ./manage-simplewiki.py initdb
        ./manage-simplewiki.py runserver

    Or of course you can just use the application object
    (`simplewiki.SimpleWiki`) and hook that into your favourite WSGI gateway.
    The constructor of the application object takes a single argument which is
    the SQLAlchemy URI for the database.

    The management script for the devserver looks up the an environment var
    called `SIMPLEWIKI_DATABASE_URI` and uses that for the database URI.  If
    no such variable is provided "sqlite:////tmp/simplewiki.db" is assumed.

`plnt`
    A planet called plnt, pronounce plant.

    Requirements:
    -   SQLAlchemy
    -   Jinja
    -   feedparser

    You can obtain all packages in the Cheeseshop via easy_install.

    Usage::

        ./manage-plnt.py initdb
        ./manage-plnt.py sync
        ./manage-plnt.py runserver

    The WSGI application is called `plnt.Plnt` which, like the simple wiki,
    accepts a database URI as first argument.  The environment variable for
    the database key is called `PLNT_DATABASE_URI` and the default is
    "sqlite:////tmp/plnt.db".

    Per default a few python related blogs are added to the database, you
    can add more in a python shell by playing with the `Blog` model.
