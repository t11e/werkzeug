Context Locals
==============

Sooner or later you have some things you want to have in every single view
or helper function or whatever.  In PHP the way to go are global variables.
However that is not possible in WSGI applications without a major drawback:
As soon as you operate on the global namespace your application is not thread
safe any longer.

The python standard library comes with a utility called "thread locals".  A
thread local is an global object where you can put stuff on and get back later
in a thread safe way.  That means whenver you set or get an object to / from
a thread local object the thread local object checks in which thread you are
and delivers the correct value.

This however has a few disadvantages.  For example beside threads there are
other ways to handle concurrency in Python.  A very popular approach are
greenlets.  And also if every request gets its own thread is not guaranteed
in WSGI.  It could be that a request is reusing a thread from before and data
is left in the thread local object.

`werkzeug.local` is filling this gap.


Nutshell
========

Here a simple example how you can use werkzeug.local:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from werkzeug import Local, LocalManager

    local = Local()
    local_manager = LocalManager([local])

    def application(environ, start_response):
        local.request = request = Request(environ)
        ...

    application = local_manager.make_middleware(application)

Now what this code does is binding request to `local.request`.  Every other
piece of code executed after this assignment in the same context can savely
access local.request and will get the same request object.  The
`make_middleware` method on the local manager ensures that everything is
cleaned up after the request.

The same context means the same greenlet (if you're using greenlets) in the
same thread and same process.

If a request object is not yet set on the local object and you try to access
it you will get an `AttributeError`.  You can use `getattr` to avoid that:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_request():
        return getattr(local, 'request', None)

This will try to get the request or return `None` if the request is not (yet?)
available.


Manager Objects
===============

Local objects cannot manage themselves, for that you need a local manager.
You can pass a local manager multiple locals or add additionals later by
appending them to `manager.locals` and everytime the manager cleans up it
will clean up all the data left in the locals for this context.

The following methods exist:

`cleanup()`
    Manually clean up the data in the locals for this context.  Call this at
    the end of the request or use `make_middleware()`.

`make_middleware(application)`
    Encapsulate the application and call `cleanup()` at the end of a request.

`get_ident()`
    Return the context identifier the local objects use internally for this
    context.  You cannot override this method to change the behavior but use
    it to link other context local objects (such as SQLAlchemy's scoped
    sessions) to the werkzeug locals.
