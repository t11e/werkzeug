=============
API Stability
=============

Werkzeug has not yet reached 1.0 and as a matter of fact some things might
change over the time.  The following modules will very likely change in
one of the next release versions:

`werkzeug.routing`
    Currently the path converter does not sort properly and we will change
    the way sorting works there.  Try to avoid path as much as possible
    for the time being.

`werkzeug.contrib`
    The community contributed modules are yet undocumented and we expect
    some upcoming changes there.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

`0.2`
    -   the `BaseReporterStream` is now part of the contrib module, the
        new module is `werkzeug.contrib.reporterstream`.  Starting with
        `0.3` the old import will not work any longer.
    -   `RequestRedirect` uses now a 301 status code.  Previously a 302
        status code was used incorrectly.  If you want to continue using
        this code use ``response = redirect(e.new_url, 302)``.
