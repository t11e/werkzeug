API Stability
=============

Werkzeug has not yet reached 1.0 and as a matter of fact some things might
change over the time.  The following modules will very likely change in
one of the next release versions:

`werkzeug.routing`
    Currently the path converter does not sort properly and we will change
    the way sorting works there.  Try to avoid path as much as possible
    for the time being.

`werkzeug.contrib`
    The community contributed modules are yet undocumented and we expect
    some upcoming changes there.
