Utilities
=========

Werkzeug comes with a bunch of utilties that can be useful for WSGI
applications. Most of the classes provided by this module are used by the
wrappers, you can however use them without the wrappers too.


MultiDict
=========

The `MultiDict` behaves like a normal dict and is in fact a subclass of it,
but it can store multiple values per key.

You can construct such a `MultiDict` from a list of ``(key, value)`` tuples
or another `MultiDict`, *not* from a dict itself.

Usage:

.. sourcecode:: pycon

    >>> from werkzeug.utils import MultiDict
    >>> d = MultiDict([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c')])
    >>> d
    MultiDict([('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c')])
    >>> d['a']
    'b'
    >>> d.getlist('a')
    ['b', 'c']
    >>> 'a' in d
    True

It behaves like a normal dict thus all dict functions will only return the
first value when multiple values for one key are found.

If you want to get or set all values use the `getlist`, `setlist`,
`setlistdefault`, `iterlists`, `lists`, `iterlistvalues`, `listvalues`,
`poplist` and `postitemlist` that work like their non list pendants but
return a list of all the values.
