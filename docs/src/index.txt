Documentation Overview
======================

Welcome to the Werkzeug documentation.


.. admonition:: Note

    The documentation reflects the status of Werkzeug 0.2 as of
    HG revision `7ed8e75a17bc`.  Currently we do some code cleanup
    in the mercurial repository, if you are using newer revisions
    of Werkzeug you should participate in ``#pocoo`` to not miss
    the latest changes.  Documentation will be update before the
    release.
