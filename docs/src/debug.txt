Debugging System
================

Depending on the WSGI gateway/server exceptions are handled differently but
most of the time exceptions go to stderr or the error log.

Since this is not the best debugging environment Werkzeug provides a WSGI
middleware that renders nice debugging tracebacks, optionally with an AJAX
based debugger.

Usage:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from myapplication import application
    from werkzeug.debug import DebuggedApplication
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

    application = DebuggedApplication(application, evalex=True)
    
    srv = make_server('localhost', 4000, application)
    srv.serve_forever()

This code spawns a Debugging Server on `localhost:4000` with the enabled
debugger. If you set `evalex` to `False` the debugger is disabled.

Don't ever use the debugging middleware in a production environment since it
can leak internal information that are part of the variable debug table. Even
worse is a enabled `evalex` interactive debugger that can be used to execute
code on the server!
