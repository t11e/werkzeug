===============
Other Libraries
===============

Because Werkzeug is just a thin layer over WSGI it's very easy to use WSGI
middlewares together with Werkzeug powered applications. It's also possible
to just use small parts of Werkzeug like the URL mapper etc with complete
different implementations or frameworks.

Here a small list of libraries you may want to try out


Database Layers
===============

If you want to use relational databases in your application.

`SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_
    SQLAlchemy is a great database layer and object relational mapper
    that let you construct SQL Queries using Python expressions. It also
    provides connection pools and plays nice with the WSGI standard.


Template Engines
================

Bigger applications deserve something better than minitmpl :)

`Genshi <http://genshi.edgewall.org/>`_
    If you like XML template engines check out Genshi. Ass-kicking
    template engine, but unfortunately not the fastest.

`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`_
    The fastest designer friendly template engine for Python. Similar
    to ERB in terms of the syntax but with a powerful template inheritance
    system and multiple namespaces.

`Jinja <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_
    Sandboxes, django/smarty like template engine but with inline
    expressions that let you execute a subset of python expressions in
    your templates.


Tools and Utilities
===================

Something's missing? Check here first

`wsgitools <http://subdivi.de/~helmut/wsgitools/>`_
    Various small WSGI utilities like a minimal traceback or auth
    middleware. It also includes an SCGI server.

`flup <http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/>`_
    flup provides a session middleware as well as an error middleware
    that can send mails to administators if something went wrong. It
    also allows you to gzip the output sent to the webserver and provides
    bridges to FastCGI, SCGI and AJP.

`paste <http://pythonpaste.org/>`_
    Many tools for use with WSGI; dispatching, composition, simple
    applications (e.g., file serving), and more.

`routes <http://routes.groovie.org/>`_
    port of the rails url mapping system.

You can find a more complete list on the `wsgi.org`_ webpage.
