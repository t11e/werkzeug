Successfully created a minimal werkzeug package structure. You can now
start the development server using the following command:

    python start-${PACKAGE}.py

After that you can open `http://localhost:5000/` which will be the
URL of the development server.

Edit the `start-${PACKAGE}.py` to alter the debugging settings.
